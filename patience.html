    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>
       <span>One, two, one, two, three, four</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>   
        <span>Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you</span><br>
        <span>I'm still alright to smile</span><br>
        <span>Girl, I think about you every day now</span><br>
        <span>Was a time when I wasn't sure</span><br>
        <span>But you set my mind at ease</span><br>
        <span>There is no doubt you're in my heart now</span><br>
    </p>    
    <p>
        <span>Said "woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine"</span><br>
        <span>All we need is just a little patience</span><br>
        <span>Said "sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine"</span><br>
        <span>All we need is just a little patience (Patience)</span><br>
        <span>Mm, yeah</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>I sit here on the stairs</span><br>
        <span>´Cause I'd rather be alone</span><br>
        <span>If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear</span><br>
        <span>Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time</span><br>
        <span>But you know love there's one more thing to consider</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>Said "woman take it slow and things will be just fine"</span><br>
        <span>You and I'll just use a little patience</span><br>
        <span>Said "sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright"</span><br>
        <span>You and I've got what it takes to make it</span><br>
        <span>We won't fake it, I'll never break it</span><br>
        <span>'Cause I can't take it</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah</span><br>
        <span>Need a little patience, yeah</span><br>
        <span>Just a little patience, yeah</span><br>
        <span>Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night)</span><br>
        <span>Just trying to get it right (A little patience, yeah)</span><br>
        <span>It's hard to see with so many around</span><br>
        <span>You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)</span><br>
        <span>And the streets don't change but maybe the names</span><br>
        <span>I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience, yeah)</span><br>
        <span>Yeah, yeah, yeah but I need you (All need more patience)</span><br>
        <span>Oh, I need you (All need some patience)</span><br>
        <span>Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)</span><br>
        <span>Ooh this time (Is all you need)</span><br>
