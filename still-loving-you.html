    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Time, it needs time</span><br>
        <span>To win back your love again</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>Love, only love</span><br>
        <span>Can bring back your love someday</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br><br>
        <span>I will be there</span>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>Fight, babe, I'll fight</span><br>
        <span>To win back your love again</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>       
        <span>Love</span><br>
        <span>Only love</span><br>
        <span>Can break down the wall someday</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>If we'd go again</span><br>
        <span>All the way from the start</span><br>
        <span>I would try to change</span><br>
        <span>Things that killed our love</span><br>
        <span>Your pride has built a wall, so strong</span><br>
        <span>That I can't get through</span><br>
        <span>Is there really no chance</span><br>
        <span>To start once again</span><br>
        <span>I'm loving you</span><br>
    </p>    
    <p>    
        <span>Try</span><br>
        <span>Baby try</span><br>
        <span>To trust in my love again</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
    </p>    
    <p>    
        <span>Love, our love</span><br>
        <span>Shouldn't be thrown away</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
        <span>I will be there</span><br>
    </p>    
    <p>

        <span>Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know</span><br>
        <span>What you've been through</span><br>
        <span>You should give me a chance</span><br>
