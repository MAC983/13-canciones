    <h2>Letra:</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Now, this mountain I must climb</span><br>
        <span>Feels like the world upon my shoulders</span><br>
        <span>Through the clouds, I see love shine</span><br>
        <span>It keeps me warm as life grows colder</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>        
        <span>In my life</span><br>
        <span>There's been heartache and pain</span><br>
        <span>I don't know</span><br>
        <span>If I can face it again</span><br>
        <span>Can't stop now</span><br>
        <span>I've travelled so far</span><br>
        <span>To change this lonely life</span><br>
    </p>   
    <p>       
        <span>I wanna know what love is</span><br>
        <span>I want you to show me</span><br>
        <span>I wanna feel what love is</span><br>
        <span>I know you can show me</span><br>
        <span>Oooh, woah-ooh</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>        
        <span>I'm gonna take a little time</span><br>
        <span>A little time to look around me</span><br>
        <span>I've got nowhere left to hide</span><br>
        <span>It looks like love has finally found me</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>        
        <span>In my life</span><br>
        <span>There's been heartache and pain</span><br>
        <span>I don't know</span><br>
        <span>If I can face it again</span><br>
        <span>Can't stop now</span><br>
