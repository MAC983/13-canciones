    <h2>Letra:</h2>
        <p>I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night <br>
        <span>Im in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you </span><br>
        <span>I want your love</span><br>
        <span>Let's break the walls between us</span><br>
        <span>Don't make it tough</span><br>
        <span>I'll put away my pride</span><br>
        <span>Enough's enough</span><br>
        <span>I've suffered and I've seen the light</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        <span>Bayayby, you're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>You're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Come and make it alright</span><br>
        </p>    
        <p>    
        <span>Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside</span><br>
        <span>Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride</span><br>
        <span>Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar</span><br>
        <span>Without your love a dog without a bone</span><br>
        <span>What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone</span><br>
        </p> 
        <p>[Chorus] <br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>You're the reason I live</span><br>
        <span>You're the reason I die</span>br
        <span>You're the reason I give when I break down and cry</span><br>
        <span>Don't need no reason why</span><br>
        <span>Baby, baby, bayayby</span><br>
        <span>You're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>You're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Yeah, come and make it alright</span><br>
        <span>You're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>You're my angel</span><br>
        <span>Come and take me alright</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
        <span>Come and save me tonight</span><br>
