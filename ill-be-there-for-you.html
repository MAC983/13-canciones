    <h2>Letra:</h2>    
    <p>
        <span>I guess this time you're really leaving</span><br>
        <span>I heard your suitcase say goodbye</span><br>
        <span>Well as my broken heart lies bleeding</span><br>
        <span>You say true love is suicide</span><br>
        <span>You say you've cried a thousand rivers</span><br>
        <span>And now you're swimming for the shore</span><br>
        <span>You left me drowning in my tears</span><br>
        <span>And you won't save me anymore</span><br>
        <span>I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you</span><br>
        <span>When you breathe, I want to be the air for you</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd live and I'd die for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd steal the sun from the sky for you</span><br>
        <span>Words can't say what love can do</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>   
        <span>I know you know we've had some good times</span><br>
        <span>Now they have their own hiding place</span><br>
        <span>Well I can promise you tomorrow</span><br>
        <span>But I can't buy back yesterday</span><br>
        <span>And baby you know my hands are dirty</span><br>
        <span>But I wanted to be your Valentine</span><br>
        <span>I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby</span><br>
        <span>When you get drunk, I'll be the wine</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you</span><br>
        <span>When you breathe I want to be the air for you</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd live and I'd die for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd steal the sun from the sky for you</span><br>
        <span>Words can't say what love can do</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>I wasn't there when you were happy</span><br>
        <span>And I wasn't there when you were down</span><br>
        <span>Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby</span><br>
        <span>I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>   
        <span>I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you</span><br>
        <span>When you breathe I want to be the air for you</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd live and I'd die for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd steal the sun from the sky for you</span><br>
        <span>Words can't say what love can do</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you</span><br>
        <span>When you breathe I want to be the air for you</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd live and I'd die for you</span><br>
        <span>I'd steal the sun from the sky for you</span><br>
        <span>Words can't say what love can do</span><br>
        <span>I'll be there for you</span><br>
