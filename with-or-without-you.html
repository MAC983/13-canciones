    <h2>Letra:</h2>    
    <p>
        <span>See the stone set in your eyes</span><br>
        <span>See the thorn twist in your side</span><br>
        <span>I'll wait for you</span><br>
        <span>Sleight of hand and twist of fate</span><br>
        <span>On a bed of nails, she makes me wait</span><br>
        <span>And I wait without you</span><br>
    </p>    
    <p>
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>Through the storm, we reach the shore</span><br>
        <span>You give it all but I want more</span><br>
        <span>And I'm waiting for you</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
        <span>With or without you, ah, ah</span><br>
        <span>I can't live</span><br>
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
        <span>And you give</span><br>
        <span>And you give</span><br>
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>My hands are tied</span><br>
        <span>My body bruised, she got me with</span><br>
        <span>Nothing to win and</span><br>
        <span>Nothing left to lose</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
        <span>And you give</span><br>
        <span>And you give</span><br>
        <span>And you give yourself away</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
        <span>With or without you, oh</span><br>
        <span>I can't live</span><br>
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
        <span>Oh, oh</span><br>
        <span>Oh, oh</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>    
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
        <span>With or without you, oh</span><br>
        <span>I can't live</span><br>
        <span>With or without you</span><br>
    </p>    
    <span>With or without you</span><br>
